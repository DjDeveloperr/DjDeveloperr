### Hi there 👋
I'm Dj, amateur young programmer. I started programming at the age of 12, with a simple project, Discord bot! I'm 14, turning 15 this year!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on PokeOne Discord Bot
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Version Control (Git), C#, Unity Game Development
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on JavaScript (Node preferably), HTML/CSS (I really love CSS), C#, Python
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to code and Pokemon :3
- 📫 How to reach me: you can't :p
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I dream code ✨
