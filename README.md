### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Dj, amateur young programmer. I started programming at the age of 12, with a simple project, Discord bot! I'm 14, turning 15 this year!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [PokeOne Discord Bot](https://top.gg/bot/473020399060385792), which is an Pokemon RPG right in Discord!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Version Control (Git), C#, Unity Game Development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on JavaScript (Node preferably), HTML/CSS (I really love CSS), C#, Python
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to code and Pokemon :3
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can't :p
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I dream code âœ¨
