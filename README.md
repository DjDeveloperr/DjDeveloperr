### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Dj

Iâ€™m a software developer. I maintain several open-source projects.
I have authored many modules in the Deno ecosystem.
Consider sponsoring if you like my work!

I primarily use JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust, sometimes Swift, C/C++,
C# or Python too.

You can find some of my open-source work in pinned repositories below!

You can reach out to me on Discord: [djdev#7001](https://djdev.me/discord) (preferred)
or via email: hey [at] djdev [dot] me.
