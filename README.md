### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Dj

Iâ€™m a hobby programmer and an open-source maintainer & contributor.

I primarily use JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust, sometimes Swift, C/C++,
C# or Python too.

You can find some of my recent open source work in pinned repositories below!

You can reach out to me on Discord: [DjDeveloper#7777](https://djdev.deno.dev/discord) (preferred)
or via email: djdeveloperr [at] gmail [dot] com.
