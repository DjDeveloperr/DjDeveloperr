### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Dj

Iâ€™m a hobby programmer. I maintain some open-source projects and also contribute!
I have authored many modules in the Deno ecosystem.
Consider sponsoring if you like my work!

I primarily use JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust, sometimes Swift, C/C++,
C# or Python too.

You can find some of my recent open-source work in pinned repositories below!

You can reach out to me on Discord: [djdev#7777](https://djdev.deno.dev/discord) (preferred)
or via email: djdeveloperr [at] gmail [dot] com.
