### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Dj, amateur 15 yo programmer. I started programming at the age of 12, with a simple project, Discord bot!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 
  - [PokeOne Discord Bot](https://top.gg/bot/473020399060385792), which is an Pokemon RPG right in Discord!
  - [Harmony](https://github.com/discord-deno/discord.deno), which is an awesome Discord Lib for [Deno](https://deno.land)!
  - Other cool Rust & TS/JS projects!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on JavaScript/TypeScript (Node preferably), HTML/CSS (I really love CSS), C#, Python
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to code :3
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can't :p
